## Assignements
I didn't know what else to call it. I might rename it later.

I might also change the folder structure to include basics, intermediate, advanced and so on once I'm at that point.

Now that I know a bit more about Markdown syntax I should go back and make it consistent.
Should also make the code comments, and formatting consistent too...
I need to get better at commenting in general.

Added a bunch of stuff to the .md's ...
Still need to add more.
Basic method examples... tuples need an explanation. 
Script examples need setting up.

It's a bit tedious, but writing the md's does help hammer the info home.
Besides I found a few things I didn't know for some of the basics, so that's good.
