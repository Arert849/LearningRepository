## Assignements
I didn't know what else to call it. I might rename it later.

I might also change the folder structure to include basics, intermediate, advanced and so on once I'm at that point.

Now that I know a bit more about Markdown syntax I should go back and make it consistent.
Should also make the code comments, and formatting consistent too...
I need to get better at commenting in general.
