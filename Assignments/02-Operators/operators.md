# Operators
Arithmetic Operators
- '+'  for addition: 10 + 3 = 13
- '-'  for subtraction: 10 - 3 = 7
- '*'  for multiplication:  10 * 3 = 30
- '/'  for division: 10 / 3 = 3.<span style="text-decoration:overline">3</span>
- '%' for modulo: 10 % 3 = 1 (Remainder)
- '**' for exponents ie. 10<sup>3</sup> = 1000
- '//' for floor division 10 // 3 = 3

Ceiling division can be done via math library or negative floor conversion.

Like so: -(-10 // 3) = 4

Comparison operators
- "==" Equal to
- "!=" Not equal
- ">" Bigger than
- ">=" Bigger or equal to
- "<" Smaller than
- "<=" Smaller or equal to

Assignment Operators:
- "=" x = 5 same as x = 5
- "+=" x += 5 same as x = x + 5
- "-=" x -= 5 same as x = x - 5
- "*=" x *= 5 same as x = x * 5
- "/=" x /= 5 same as x = x / 5
- "%=" x %= 5 same as x = x % 5
- "//=" x //= 5 same as x = x // 5
- "**=" x **= 5 same as x = x ** 5

Logical Operators
- 'and' if a and b returns True if variable a AND variable b are True
- 'or' if a or b returns True if either of the variables is True
- 'not' if not a returns True if a is not True

Membership and Identity Operators
- 'in' a in b returns True if sequence a is found in object b
- 'not in' a not in b returns True if the sequence is not found in object b
- 'is' a is b returns True if a and b are the same object
- 'is not' a is not b returns True if a and b are not the same object.
