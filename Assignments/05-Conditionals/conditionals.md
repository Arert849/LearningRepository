Conditionals use logical and comparison operators. Remember about all() and any(), they're useful.
Loops can also have 'else' statements. They activate when the loop doesn't 'break' and iterates to completion.

    for i in range(3):
        print(i)
    else:
        print("Will print once the loop iterates to completion")

Don't really know what else to type here...
