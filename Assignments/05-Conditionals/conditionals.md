Conditionals use logical and comparison operators. any() and all() apply to iterable objects

    test_list = [True, False, False, True]
    if any(test_list):
        print("Will print as some values are True")
    
    if all(test_list):
        print("Will not print as not all values are True")

Don't really know what else to type here...
